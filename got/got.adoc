== Analyzing Text

image::{img}/AStormOfSwords.jpg[float=right]

Most of this demo is based on work done by Dr. Andrew Beveridge, based on his https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/[Network of Thrones^] research.

Article: 
https://www.macalester.edu/~abeverid/index.html[Beveridge, Andrew, Shan, Jie. Network of Thrones. Math Horizons Magazine, Vol. 23, No. 4 (2016) pp. 18-22.^]

== Graph of Character Interactions

Build a graph where each character of the story is a node and the relationships represent character interactions.

____
Link two characters each time their names (or nicknames) *appear within 15 words of one another*.

Each link corresponds to an interaction between the two characters. 
Note that this interaction could be direct or indirect. 
Here are some of the types of interactions that our method picks up.

* Two characters appearing together in the same location
* Two characters in conversation
* One character talking about another character
* One character listening to a third character talk about a second character
* A third character talking about two other characters
____

How the data was extracted from the books is described in detail here: https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/from-book-to-network/

== Import

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (c:Character) ASSERT c.name IS UNIQUE;
----

We can import the co-occurences for all books first, which will also create all characters:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf/master/data/asoiaf-all-edges.csv" AS row
MERGE (src:Character {name: row.Source})
MERGE (tgt:Character {name: row.Target})
// global relationship
MERGE (src)-[r:INTERACTS]->(tgt) ON CREATE SET r.weight = toInteger(row.weight)
----

Then for each of the books we can create a dedicated relationship, suffixed with the number of the book.

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf/master/data/asoiaf-book1-edges.csv" AS row
MATCH (src:Character {name: row.Source})
MATCH (tgt:Character {name: row.Target})
// relationship for the book
MERGE (src)-[r:INTERACTS1]->(tgt) ON CREATE SET r.weight = toInt(row.weight), r.book=1
----

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf/master/data/asoiaf-book2-edges.csv" AS row
MATCH (src:Character {name: row.Source})
MATCH (tgt:Character {name: row.Target})
// relationship for the book
MERGE (src)-[r:INTERACTS2]->(tgt) ON CREATE SET r.weight = toInt(row.weight), r.book=2
----

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf/master/data/asoiaf-book3-edges.csv" AS row
MATCH (src:Character {name: row.Source})
MATCH (tgt:Character {name: row.Target})
// relationship for the book
MERGE (src)-[r:INTERACTS3]->(tgt) ON CREATE SET r.weight = toInt(row.weight), r.book=3
----

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf/master/data/asoiaf-book45-edges.csv" AS row
MATCH (src:Character {name: row.Source})
MATCH (tgt:Character {name: row.Target})
// relationship for the book
MERGE (src)-[r:INTERACTS45]->(tgt) ON CREATE SET r.weight = toInt(row.weight), r.book=45

== Analyzing The Network

=== Number of characters

796 Characters with 2823 interactions across all books.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character) RETURN count(c)
----

Interactions per book

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[r]->() 
RETURN r.book as book, count(r) ORDER BY book 
----

=== Summary statistics

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)-[:INTERACTS]->()
WITH c, count(*) AS num
RETURN min(num) AS min, max(num) AS max, avg(num) AS avg_characters, stdev(num) AS stdev
----

Across all books:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)-[r]->()
WITH r.book as book, c, count(*) AS num
RETURN book, min(num) AS min, max(num) AS max, avg(num) AS avg_characters, stdev(num) AS stdev
ORDER BY book
----

== Diameter of the network

The diameter (or geodesic) of a network is defined as the longest shortest path in the network.

[source,cypher]
----
// Find maximum diameter of network
// maximum shortest path between two nodes
MATCH (a:Character), (b:Character) WHERE id(a) > id(b)
MATCH p=shortestPath((a)-[:INTERACTS*]-(b))
WITH length(p) AS len, p
ORDER BY len DESC LIMIT 4
RETURN len, extract(x IN nodes(p) | x) AS path
----

== Shortest Path

We can use the shortestPath function in Cypher to find the shortest path between any two characters in the graph. 
Let’s find the shortest path from Catelyn Stark to Kahl Drogo:

[source,cypher]
----
// Shortest path from Catelyn Stark to Khal Drogo
MATCH (catelyn:Character {name:"Catelyn-Stark"}), (drogo:Character {name:"Drogo"})
MATCH p=shortestPath((catelyn)-[:INTERACTS*]-(drogo))
RETURN p
----

For only book 3 the path is much longer.

[source,cypher]
----
// Shortest path from Catelyn Stark to Khal Drogo
MATCH (catelyn:Character {name:"Catelyn-Stark"}), (drogo:Character {name:"Drogo"})
MATCH p=shortestPath((catelyn)-[:INTERACTS3*]-(drogo))
RETURN p
----

=== All shortest paths

There might be other paths of the same length connecting Catelyn and Drogo. 
We can find these with the allShortestPaths Cypher function:

[source,cypher]
----
// All shortest paths from Catelyn Stark to Khal Drogo
MATCH (catelyn:Character {name:"Catelyn-Stark"}), (drogo:Character {name:"Drogo"})
MATCH p=allShortestPaths((catelyn)-[:INTERACTS3*]-(drogo))
RETURN p
----


== Pivotal Nodes

A node is said to be pivotal if it lies on all shortest paths between two other nodes in the network. 
We can find all pivotal nodes in the network.

.Source: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/[Networks, Crowds, Markets]

This runs for a bit, as it has to compute across: 

[source,cypher]
----
// Find all pivotal nodes in network
MATCH (a:Character), (b:Character) WHERE id(a) > id(b)
MATCH p=allShortestPaths((a)-[:INTERACTS*..9]-(b)) WITH collect(p) AS paths, a, b
UNWIND nodes(head(paths)) as c // first path
WITH * WHERE NOT c IN [a,b] AND all(path IN tail(paths) WHERE c IN nodes(path))
RETURN a.name, b.name, c.name AS PivotalNode, length(head(paths)) as pathLength, length(paths) as pathCount SKIP 490 LIMIT 10
----


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Character {name: "Drogo"}), (b:Character {name: "Ramsay-Snow"})
MATCH p=allShortestPaths((a)-[:INTERACTS*]-(b))
RETURN p
----

== Centrality measures

In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph. 
Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, and super-spreaders of disease.

This reproduces (partly) what Andrew Beveridge https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/the-novels/[did for the novels^]

We use the https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/a-primer-on-network-analysis/[great explanations given by Andrew for the different network metrics^]

=== Degree Centrality

____
The degree centrality of a node is the number other nodes that are directly connected to it via a relationships. 
This is just a raw count of the number of people that the character interacted with at least once.
____

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
RETURN c.name AS character, size( (c)-[:INTERACTS]-() ) AS degree 
ORDER BY degree DESC
----

By book:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
UNWIND [1,2,3,45] as book
WITH book, c.name AS character, size( (c)-[{book:book}]-() ) AS degree 
RETURN character, collect([book,degree]) as degrees, max(degree) as maxDegree
ORDER BY maxDegree DESC;
----

=== Weighted Degree Centrality

____
The weighted degree centrality is the sum of the weights of the relationships of the node. 
This is the total number of interactions involving the character.
____

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)-[r:INTERACTS]-()
RETURN c.name AS character, sum(r.weight) AS weightedDegree 
ORDER BY weightedDegree DESC LIMIT 100
----

By book:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
UNWIND [1,2,3,45] as book
MATCH (c)-[r {book:book}]-()
WITH book, c.name AS character, sum(r.weight) AS weightedDegree
RETURN character, collect([book,weightedDegree]) as weightedDegrees, max(weightedDegree) as maxDegree
ORDER BY maxDegree DESC;
----

== Neo4j Graph Algorithms

image::{img}/apoc_proc.png[float=right]

=== User Defined Procedures

User defined procedures are written in Java, deployed to the database and callable from Cypher.

=== APOC Procedures
The https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC library^] is a library of useful procedures and functions for many common Neo4j tasks, including https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_graph_algorithms[graph algorithms^], data import, refactoring, indexing, system monitoring, ...

You install them by downloading the last release, putting it into $NEO4J_HOME/plugins and restarting Neo4j.
The http://neo4j.com/sandbox[Neo4j-Sandbox^] comes with APOC pre-installed.

=== Neo4j Graph Algorithms
The https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms[Neo4j Graph Algorithms library] bundles several user defined procedures for running graph algorithms in Neo4j. You can access the most recent Neo4j Graph Algorithms release https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[here].

==== Procedure Sandboxing

As an additional security feature, procedures are sandboxed within Neo4j, restricting their access to the database. To use our graph algorithm procedures we'll need to edit `neo4j.conf` and add:

> dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=*

To give unrestricted access to all procedures.

== Betweenness Centrality

____
Betweenness centrality identifies nodes that are strategically positioned in the network, meaning that information will often travel through that person. 
Such an intermediary position gives that person power and influence. 
Betweenness centrality is a raw count of the number of short paths that go through a given node. 
For example, if a node is located on a bottleneck between two large communities, then it will have high betweenness
____

image::{img}/betweenness-centrality.png[]

The red nodes have a high betweenness centrality and are connectors of clusters.



We can run Betweenness Centrality using the `algo` package. This will calculate betweenness centrality for each node and set the `betweenness` property:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.betweenness('Character', 'INTERACTS', {write:true, writeProperty:"betweenness", stats:true})
----

Then to find the characters with the highest betweenness centrality:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character) WHERE exists(c.betweenness)
RETURN c.name AS name, c.betweenness AS betweenness ORDER BY betweenness DESC LIMIT 25
----

== Closeness Centrality

Nodes with high closeness centality are often highly connected within clusters in the graph, but not necessarily highly connected outside of the cluster.

Closeness centrality is the inverse of the average distance to all other characters in the network (farness).

image::{img}/closeness-centrality.png[]

Nodes with high closeness centrality are connected to many other nodes in a network.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
WITH collect(c) AS characters
CALL apoc.algo.closeness(['INTERACTS'], characters, 'BOTH') YIELD node, score
RETURN node.name AS name, score 
ORDER BY score DESC
----

== PageRank

____
This is another version of weighted degree centrality with a feedback loop. 
This time, you only get your “fair share” of your neighbor’s importance. 
That is, your neighbor’s importance is split between their neighbors, proportional to the number of interactions with that neighbor. 
Intuitively, PageRank captures how effectively you are taking advantage of your network contacts. 
In our context, PageRank centrality nicely captures narrative tension. 
Indeed, major developments occur when two important characters interact.
____

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character) WITH collect(c) AS nodes
CALL apoc.algo.pageRankWithConfig(nodes,{types:'INTERACTS'}) YIELD node, score
RETURN node.name, score
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 100
----

== Community Detection

We can detect communities in our data by running an algorithm which traverses the graph structure to find highly connected subgraphs with fewer connections other other subgraphs.

For the label propagation algorithm that is used in this implementation, we need to normalize our weight to a range of 0..1.
For simplicity we just normalize it on the max weight value.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[r:INTERACTS]->() WITH toFloat(max(r.weight)) as max
MATCH ()-[r:INTERACTS]->() SET r.nweight = toFloat(r.weight) / max
----

Run the algorithm

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.algo.community(25,['Character'],'community','INTERACTS','BOTH','nweight',10000);
----

Largest Communities, group characters by community-id, select the people with the largest degree as main ones.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
WITH c, c.community as community, size( (c)-[:INTERACTS]-() ) as degree ORDER BY community ASC, degree DESC
WITH community, (head(collect(c))).name as main, count(*) as size, collect(c.name)[0..7] as characters, collect(c) as all
ORDER BY size DESC
FOREACH (c IN all | SET c.communityName = main)
RETURN community, main, size, characters
----

We could even label our character nodes with their community label and use it for visualizing.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
CALL apoc.create.addLabels(c,[c.communityName]) yield node
RETURN count(*)
----

E.g. showing the top 50 characters and their connections.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character) 
WITH c ORDER BY size( (c)-[:INTERACTS]-() ) DESC LIMIT 50
WITH collect(c) as characters
RETURN [c IN characters | [ (c)-[r:INTERACTS]-(o) WHERE o IN characters AND r.weight > 30 | [c,r,o]]] as graph
----

image::{img}/got-community-interactions.jpg[]

With the latest APOC release we can even visually group our characters by `communityName`.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.nodes.group(['Character'],['communityName'])
----

image::{img}/got-group-communities.jpg[]

// CALL apoc.nodes.group(['Character'],['communityName'],['INTERACTS'])
