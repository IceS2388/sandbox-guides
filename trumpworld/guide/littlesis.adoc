= Extending The Data Model - LittleSis 

== Extending The Network - LittleSis People and organizations

One of the benefits of the graph data model is the ability to combine datasets and query across them. Next we will look at how we can extend the graph by adding new entities from the LittleSis data set. The model will not change as we will only bring people and organizations.


== LittleSis.org

Data can be explored online at https://littlesis.org/lists[littlesis.org]

== The Data

We are going to use a small portion of the data. You can find them as CSV files at https://github.com/johnymontana/neo4j-datasets/tree/master/trumpworld/data[https://github.com/johnymontana/neo4j-datasets/tree/master/trumpworld/data]

Let's have a quick look at the LittleSis graph:
