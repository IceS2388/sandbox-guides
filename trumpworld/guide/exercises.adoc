The following slides contain some questions to help guide us as we explore the dataset. Keep in mind the data model to the right as you write the graph patterns necessary to answer the questions.

Consult the http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/cypher-refcard/[Cypher Reference Card] to help find the syntax / commands for constructing your query.

The typical format for writing each query will be:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ...some graph pattern...
RETURN ...
----

== Get familiar with the data... basic lookups

image::{img}/datamodel.png[float=right]

=== Looking for exact matches

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Organization) 
WHERE o.name = 'AFRICA-ISRAEL INVESTMENTS' 
RETURN o
----

or a more compact version:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Organization { name : 'AFRICA-ISRAEL INVESTMENTS' } ) 
RETURN o
----

* Try to find the UCLA Hospital
* Not a person called Scott Walker


=== Looking for approximate matches

Legislator name starting with...

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (o:Organization)
WHERE o.name STARTS WITH "CA"
RETURN o
----

you have other approximate match functions: 'ENDS WITH', 'CONTAINS', '~'. Check the Cypher refcard for more.
Filters can be combined logically with AND & OR

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (x:Person)
WHERE x.name CONTAINS 'BI' AND ...
RETURN x
----

* Find organizations containing the word Mexico in their name

== Get familiar with the data... let's start building graph patterns with Cypher

You can build a pattern incrementally by adding new queries

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "ROSS"
MATCH (p)-[:DIRECTOR]-(o)
WHERE o.name CONTAINS "MEXICO"
RETURN p, o
----

or compact all patterns first patterns first:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTOR]-(o)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS "ROSS" AND o.name CONTAINS "MEXICO"
RETURN *
----

* Find the organizations that have the word Chicago in their name and have DJT as president


== Aggregation, stats...

Number of organizations a person is connected to:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)-[:INVOLVED_WITH]->(o:Organization) 
RETURN n.name AS personName, COUNT(o) AS orgCount
ORDER BY orgCount DESC LIMIT 10
----

* Find the number of board members in organizations ( relationship name is BOARD )

Now we can build more complex queries by 'chaining' them using the WITH clause in Cypher

What's the average/max/min number of organizations a person is connected to:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person)-[:INVOLVED_WITH]->(o:Organization) 
WITH n.name as personName, COUNT(o) AS numberOrgs
RETURN AVG(numberOrgs) AS averageNumOrgs, MAX(numberOrgs) AS maxNumOrgs, MIN(numberOrgs) AS minNumOrgs
----

* Can you find organizations that have more than three people connected to them through the INVOLVED_WITH relationship
* Build similar queries with other types of relationships and using different limits and try to understand what the results mean


== Explore by Organization

* Can you find banks in the network?
* Who are the people connected to these banks?

== Explore by type of relationship

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r]-(other)
WHERE r.connection CONTAINS "Nominee"
RETURN *
----

* Find connections about loans? Nominees?
